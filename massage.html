                        <p class="card-text">Thai Massage Therapy also Known as Thai Yoga, or in Thai, Nuad Boran, IS a 2500-year-old Therapeutic Healing Technique with roots in Ancient Ayurvedic and Yogic practices found in both India and Thailand. In todays Thailand, it
                            is used and prescribed by Thai Medicine Doctors along with special herbs and nutrition as one of the first treatments when an ailment or injury occurs in a patient. Thai Massage Therapy is a Hands-on Holistic Healing Session
                            where the receiver remains clothed and lies on a Thai Massage Mat on the floor. The practitioner is often referred to as “Giving Yoga” to the receiver as he or she uses their hands, thumbs, elbows, knees and feet to manipulate
                            the soft tissues and Sen Lines (Nerve energy lines) while stretching the limbs in gentle twists and Asanas. This process helps realign the muscles, joints, fascia and internal organs thru Kineseology, rhythmic massage, acupressure,
                            energy work, and meditation. Thai Massage Therapy stimulates and balances the flow of healing energy within the body, opening the areas which are blocked bringing the person deeper into balance and harmony for health, happiness,
                            and well-being. This system creates a powerful release of stress and tension, an increase in vitality and health as it deepens the connection between mind, body, and spirit in both the giver and receiver. Therapeutic Sessions
                            include Breathing techniques, alignment, and the use of Thai Pressure Points for relieving Back, Neck, Shoulder, Hip, Leg and ankle pain or displacement due to previous or even unknown injuries. Cynthia also offers treatments
                            for Migraines, Menstruation pain, Stomach issues, wrist, hand and finger problems</p>
